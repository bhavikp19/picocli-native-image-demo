Examples for creating GraalVM native images for picocli-based applications

== Introduction

This project shows examples of creating native images for picocli-based Java command line applications that can run as standalone executables on Windows, Linux and MacOS without requiring a JVM to be installed.

GraalVM does not have cross-compile support for native images https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/407[yet], so at the moment you need to compile on Windows to get a Windows executable, compile on Linux to get a Linux executable, and on MacOS to get a MacOS executable. 

This project shows how to do this with a Continuous Integration setup, using GitHub Actions, AppVeyor and TravisCI.
The current setup creates Linux and MacOS executables with GitHub Actions, and a Windows executable on AppVeyor and TravisCI. 

This project uses Gradle, see https://github.com/remkop/picocli-native-image-maven-demo[picocli-native-image-maven-demo] for a Maven build example.

== Artifacts

=== CheckSum

The main project builds a `checksum` executable.
This is a picocli-based command line application. 
On Windows it uses Jansi to show colors on the console and the `picocli-jansi-graalvm` library to enable the Jansi library for GraalVM native applications. 


=== HTTPS

There is also a `https` subproject that builds a `demo` native executable with `https-client` and `https-server` subcommands to demonstrate HTTPS TSL client and server applications.
The server uses a self-signed certificate. 

The https subproject also demonstrates that it is possible to build native TSL applications with GraalVM that work without the `sunec.so` or `sunec.dll` library.

This can be achieved by specifying a `-J-Djava.security.properties=/full/path/to/java.security.overrides` option when building the native image.
The specified `java.security.overrides` file contains an entry for `security.provider.3` with a non-existing value.
This disables the SunEC elliptical curve encryption provider, which would have required the `sunec.so` or `sunec.dll` native library. 

== Install Compiler Toolchain

The setup for your Continuous Integration environment needs to have a JDK, and the toolchain to compile C/C++ code.

=== Linux and MacOS Compiler Toolchain

For compilation `native-image` depends on the local toolchain, so on Linux and MacOS we need `glibc-devel`, `zlib-devel` (header files for the C library and zlib) and `gcc` to be available on our system. The below is not required with GitHub Actions, since these are already available:

On Linux: `sudo dnf install gcc glibc-devel zlib-devel` or `sudo apt-get install build-essential libz-dev`.

On macOS, execute `xcode-select --install`.

=== Windows Compiler Toolchain

GraalVM https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/1258[needs] the https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8442[Microsoft Windows SDK for Windows 7 and .NET Framework 4] as well as the https://stackoverflow.com/a/45784634/873282[C compilers from KB2519277].

You can install these using https://chocolatey.org/docs/installation[chocolatey]:

----
choco install windows-sdk-7.1 kb2519277
----

Then (from the `cmd` prompt), activate the sdk-7.1 environment:

----
call "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Bin\SetEnv.cmd"
----

This starts a new Command Prompt, with the sdk-7.1 environment enabled. All subsequent commands must be run in this Command Prompt window.



== Gradle

The Gradle build uses the wonderful https://github.com/palantir/gradle-graal[gradle-graal plugin] from Palantir. This plugin will download the GraalVM JDK and unzip it and build with that. 

The plugin has https://github.com/palantir/gradle-graal/pull/127[support for Windows], and it will take care of calling `call "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Bin\SetEnv.cmd"` to ensure the `native-image` generation is done after the windows-sdk-7.1 environment is set up.

This makes your Gradle setup very simple. See the project https://github.com/remkop/picocli-native-image-demo/blob/master/build.gradle[build.gradle].


== Building Native Images Manually

CAUTION: Below is work in progress

=== Instructions for Windows

* Install Java 8
* Install Git for Windows
* Install https://chocolatey.org/docs/installation[Chocolatey]
* Get the Microsoft Windows SDK for Windows 7 and .NET Framework 4 (ISO): https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8442

----
choco install windows-sdk-7.1 kb2519277
----

Then (from the `cmd` prompt), activate the sdk-7.1 environment:

----
call "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Bin\SetEnv.cmd"
----

You will need to add `msvcr100.dll` (from `C:\Windows\System32`) from VS C++ Redistributable 2010.
